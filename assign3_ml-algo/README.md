# House Price Prediction with ML Algorithms

## Introduction

This project implements multiple machine learning models to predict house prices based on various features. The models used include:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Multiple Regression**
- **Polynomial Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **K-Means Clustering**

The dataset is synthetically generated and includes house features like square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, house age, and location score.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have **Python 3.10+** installed. You also need to install the required dependencies:

If using Jupyter Notebook, install the packages within the notebook:

```python
 ! pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Running the Project

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in **VS Code** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the ML models.
4. The script will:
   - Generate synthetic house price data.
   - Train various regression models.
   - Perform PCA for dimensionality reduction.
   - Apply K-Means clustering for house categorization.
   - Visualize predictions and analysis results.

## Dependencies

- **Python 3.10+**
- **NumPy** (for numerical computations)
- **Matplotlib** (for visualizations)
- **Seaborn** (for statistical plotting)
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning models and preprocessing)

## Results

The project provides:

- House price predictions based on multiple regression techniques.
- Regression lines and scatter plots for visualizing model accuracy.
- PCA transformation to analyze feature importance.
- K-Means clustering to segment houses into price groups.
